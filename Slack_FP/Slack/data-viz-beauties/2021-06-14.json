So, regarding what happened in 2003, i wanted to actually try to understand that and visualise it using the rest of the data so that the dashboard could explain a story, but unfortunately i didn’t find anything in the data that could explain that behaviour.. maybe changes in regulation?\nNoted on the colour, they were chosen to keep the theme consistent like you mention although i completely understand how they can create confusion when looking at the other graphs.\nFinally, the correlation between No2 and So2 was quite off topic. After not being able to find an explanation for the dramatic increase in No2 pollution and not wanting to repeat graphics to cover So2 solely i decided to add it although i was never convinced!\nFinding a good data set proved to be quite hard",

So, regarding what happened in 2003, i wanted to actually try to understand that and visualise it using the rest of the data so that the dashboard could explain a story, but unfortunately i didn’t find anything in the data that could explain that behaviour.. maybe changes in regulation?\nNoted on the colour, they were chosen to keep the theme consistent like you mention although i completely understand how they can create confusion when looking at the other graphs.\nFinally, the correlation between No2 and So2 was quite off topic. After not being able to find an explanation for the dramatic increase in No2 pollution and not wanting to repeat graphics to cover So2 solely i decided to add it although i was never convinced!\nFinding a good data set proved to be quite hard"

I think the map requires a bit of attention, because the blue blobs blend into eachother and i can see one big label for san antonio, unexpectedly. try adjusting your opacity for the marks, and play with colours \/border to get a better affect - you may also just want to gíve the map more real estate.
