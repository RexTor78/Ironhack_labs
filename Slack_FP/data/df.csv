Thank you for your first set of lab work these two days, it’s great to see you all set up with your tools and infrastructure for the course, plus getting used to submitting work via the student portal. The teaching team can see when your work comes in, who is late etc, but we also learn a lot from looking at your submitted work - what students are struggling with and if we need to provide direct feedback or more instruction. Things I learnt:
• one of you can lick their own elbow! :muscle:
• one of you has more than 16 cousins!  :glitch_crab:
• one of you agrees with me that cilantro/coriander tastes like soap :face_vomiting:
• theres an icehockey world championship that looks like a lot of fun! :ice_hockey_stick_and_puck:
• some of you like scuba diving and beaches and the photos of these destinations are amazing :diving_mask:
• one of you has a friend dressed as a superhero :male_superhero:
Feedback
• read the instructions on each lab carefully. If you are asked to write a .txt file, we expect to see a text file in the github repo. 
• when we say fun fact… we really do mean something fun, use your imagination :) 
• submit the url as well as pushing the content to your repo - otherwise we cant see you have completed the work! 
• please run all cells in your notebook before pushing to github 
• if displaying any images in your notebook, the image file will also need to be pushed to the github repo 
• always name your jupyter notebook files before pushing to github",False,0,general,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-01,12:31:00

3. Press on *Start Import,* :three: (that field might be hidden a bit. you might need to maximize your Workbench window). Import should take a couple of seconds

as a project, you can apply your SQL skills and either read the data into Python using those sqlpy query methods we saw, or extract to a csv and query with Tableau to visualise. Lots of scientific data in there but you can just search the data sets for something that interests you

a general request - please attend the daily stand up calls on time with your mentor, or preferably arrive a few minutes early so your group can start on time.
• In practice, these calls are typically very short.  
• Stand up calls are to help you stay on track with your projects, so this is a good time to flag any blockers
• I recommend you actively use your kanban boards to reassure your mentor that you are on track for the end of week deliverable. 
*Missing a stand up call will count as an absence for that day. If you cannot attend at the prescribed time, then rearrange a call with your mentor for later in the day please.*

419,Sian Davies,"good morning <!channel>! welcome to day 2 of your mid bootcamp project.
• Enjoy learning as you code and today, try focusing on 1 or 2 *specific data questions* as you are analysing your data. Remember questions generally start with a where, who, what, why, when or how.  These can be represented and explored with charts and within dashboards. 
• As you create these charts, consider the *visual best practices* we covered in week 2 - I would recommend returning to the slides to see if there were some steps that could be taken to better visually communicate the insight
• An assumption of a relationship, eg. “this data will be correlated with this other data”, is something I often see students starting with. This is a *hypothesis*, you start from a null hypothesis, and in order to prove that relationship, data analysts would conduct robust statistical tests. You must also consider bias, that your sample may not be representative and include confidence bands to represent uncertainty.

By scaling the price you put a maths barrier between yourselves and the real sale prices, so your MAE is now tiny, because its about the difference between scaled predictions and scaled actuals… ie, the proportion of error is the same, but the number is not easily relatable to $price, which should be left unscaled, ideally.",False,0,general,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-07-05,17:27:00

615,Sian Davies,"** FEEDBACK on the lab - real estate data predictions **

overall most of you made a good job with this lab. But what we were looking for was at least 3 iterations - and its a shame that we spent a lot of time running through this lab in other lectures, and Miguel did a run through of the lab in class on Wednesday, but I saw many jupyter notebooks that had obviously not been revisited and improved. Remember data analysis is an iterative process - next week you will be building on a notebook every day for the music recommender, so you wont have any choice in adopting this practice!

The best I saw on this lab came from <@U0225RHK6Q1> <@U021T7DU0BC> <@U021ZC6JR28> <@U0225RGM941> <@U022VC1JD29> :tada:

• things to avoid : 
_It is generally better not to scale your dependent variable, ie the thing you want to predict. In this case that was the *price* column. If you scale that price, then any prediction array you create is hard to make sense of, and the metrics eg MAE become very divorced from the real problem._ 

_In some data problems removing the outliers can make your model perform worse with linear regression. Something to watch for!_

_some of you dropped any columns that show correlation - instead, you can identify the highly correlated pairs and drop one from each pair._ 

• things to do more of: 
_visualise your data! Especially important to visualise the distributions of each column before and after applying any scaling or log transformation. This tells you if your method was successful because you can see how the shape of your data has changed. Visualise does not just mean do the correlation matrix!_ :face_palm:

_In the EDA stage, identify the clean and wrangling steps and write down directly in the notebook what you have planned to do, to return to later_ :white_check_mark:

_Annotate the cells in your notebook - this is best practice. Next week I will do more of this in class, so I hope to see you copying this--- imagine that someone (like me!) has to try to understand your notebook afterwards, and be sympathetic!_ :pencil2:

_Maybe get in the habit of naming your iterations eg It1,It2,It3, and thus X_it3,y_it3… this avoids confusion when returning to one of your models later_:building_construction:

_Summarise at the end of your notebook - how accurate was each iteration, and compare them. You can do that visually or just in a markdown cell. It makes it much easier for us to review, but also I gave you a placeholder in the outlier for this - don’t leave it empty!_:fire_extinguisher:",False,0,general,1,Dámaris Clariana,0,0,0,15:40:00,2021-07-09,14:38:00

785,Sian Davies,"seems like very comprehensive data and a really nice layout on your dashboard <@U021ZC6L676>! do be careful with re-using one colour to mean different things as there could be a misinterpretation they are related.  we have orange and red being reused to signify urban, stations, traffic and the west part of germany. i think you could pay more attention to your use of text int the labels on the map, axis, pie charts - theres a lot of text on here, which could be cleaned up without detracting from the message. one simple thing to enhance the impact of the viz is to avoid cognitive overload : save your text for an eye catching heading, embed a question in the heading and think about the order in which someone will explore the dashboard - if you make it intuitive (like drill down from bar chart 1 to barchart 2) then you dont need so much supporting text",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,13:49:00

I like the 6 card layout, but i wonder if you could have picked a less diverse colour scheme..? and the overall look is quite busy  to my eyes, with a lot to read and make sense of. a couple of suggestions - can you switch the bar charts around upper right, so the labels read horizontally ? could you make all the charts grey but pick out spain on each one? that could be very interesting - then it would hang together a bit more into one story. maybe have one dashboard heading too?
the other thing is to reorder the rows in the circle chart - im not sure i completely understand what the chart is showing me but i notice that the labels for &lt;10 and &lt;15 are in the wrong order",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,13:53:00

788,Sian Davies,"hi Sathiya, looks like a nice data source that you found! your dashboard feels a little bit hectic because of the charts being very busy and colourful, also all different colours, lots of labels and spiky lines, so its cognitively overwhelming and its hard to follow a story in there. can you add a single heading, perhaps a question, which stands as the dashboard header and ties everything together?. can you try using a single colour scheme of complementary colours? what about picking just two charts and seeing what could be done with those, or selecting and focusing on one pollutant at a time?

791,Sian Davies,"i would be inclined to perhaps not include the map, as its visually distracting (maybe a scatter instead, which would have a smaller profile) -and to consider reducing the number of countries to only the top 10 --- this would make better use of your space and things could line up better - you have a lot of grey space in the middle of the dashboard!

I am glad that you decided to focus on NO2 only, as this is easier to interpret than some of the others I have seen. the map is also nice and clean. I do wonder if something could be done to make better use of space ? it seems to me that you could almost overlay your map on the line chart because theres room in the ocean for the sudden 2013+ rise, and then as the scatter plot is asking a separate question, that could be an accompanying chart, offset.
be careful with inadvertent colour associations - i confused your map colours with the line chart colours, before realising it was a theme choice - the better thing to do would be only colour residential and rural in that dark brown, (as its the stand out worst line), fade the others to grey to match the map, and repeat the colour scale on the scatter plot.",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,15:15:00
793,Sian Davies,"Anna! nice use of the colours orange, blue and teal across the bar and pie chart, so they match, and a stacked bar gets the message across well. I wonder if the pie chart is needed though - it sort of reinforces what we see in the bar chart and without the pie chart, the map would have more room and you could do a nice big overall title.
• I guess this makes more sense in the interactive version, because i think I would select a province and then see the monitoring stations highlighted, is that right? in screenshot form it doesnt quite work visually, as i lose any sense of perspective. see how you feel about hiding the bar chart axis and relying on the tooltips for the values, i think it would be cleaner, also drop the grid lines",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,15:19:00
794,Sian Davies,"Great. I feel like theres a really useful story here hiding in the donut chart centre - how many days over acceptable levels it has been. does that filter from the map ?
for me the pie of your donut just has too many sections/ colours, and the colours of the provinces arent reflected in the colours on the map which is confusing. using a donut the span of the bar charts means a lot of wasted space around it, what about putting this information either on a tooltip or as a simple KPI number?
  you could also clean up your map a bit - do we need to see the country names?
I do like the minimal use of colours, min max, on the bar charts, and the red green scale on the map, i just think its the pie chart throwing your visual efforts away !",False,1,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,Pedro Pablo Errazuriz,00:00:00,2021-06-14,15:24:00

So, regarding what happened in 2003, i wanted to actually try to understand that and visualise it using the rest of the data so that the dashboard could explain a story, but unfortunately i didn’t find anything in the data that could explain that behaviour.. maybe changes in regulation?
Noted on the colour, they were chosen to keep the theme consistent like you mention although i completely understand how they can create confusion when looking at the other graphs.
Finally, the correlation between No2 and So2 was quite off topic. After not being able to find an explanation for the dramatic increase in No2 pollution and not wanting to repeat graphics to cover So2 solely i decided to add it although i was never convinced!

probably you didnt want to do another bar chart here, but as a better chart choice, can i suggest pick the two age groups (or better keep children separate but join adults and seniors in one group) and create a scatter, which could be plotted to the right side of the bar, working with a hover highlighter action would show how many children and adults in that borough have been impacted by air pollution - give it a try!",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,17:38:00

 I like the us flag, for a bit of a visual, but its quite overpowering- i wonder if you could integrate it into your background instead? I think the map requires a bit of attention, because the blue blobs blend into eachother and i can see one big label for san antonio, unexpectedly. try adjusting your opacity for the marks, and play with colours /border to get a better affect - you may also just want to gíve the map more real estate. I like the big bold title but in terms of other text, you could have a clean up easily  - the chart titles, axis labels - consider if they are needed and if theres a better way to display those. its helpful to see those air pollutant trend lines heading down though, maybe theres a story in there you could bring out more?",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,17:47:00

Although i do love a donut it feels a little isolated here… what about using icons for child, adult, elderly people, and varying their size depending on the proportion affected per borough? my other idea would be switch to floating mode to see if you can get the donut a bit tighter with the map. im also not convinced about the blue…. try a grey palette and see how that looks !",False,0,data-viz-beauties,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-14,17:53:00

• data format is JSON
• data looks clean and would probably not need more than a simple parsing to turn the strings into numbers and outlier removal
• JSON is pretty simple and could be merged with other data sources without too much effort
• one could answer any questions about numerical state of the weather at any geographic point on the planet and categorical questions could be derived from numerical values with a bit of programming
• one could gain concrete knowledge about pollution levels at each point and find correlations between the weather state on different points on the globe and build forecasting models
• as an example: being able to forecast an upcoming increase in pollution levels of a certain substance beyond harmful levels may enable us to take necessary measures to mitigate the damage
• one could easily imagine a system that is fed the weather info through the abovementioned api and dispatches ""warning events"" based on domain metrics to institutions that are qualified to take action ",False,0,data-resources,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-06-01,09:23:00

:github: A github hint, because we're seeing this every time at the beginning of the bootcamp - which is fine, don't worry :slightly_smiling_face:, but avoiding this can save you a lot of trouble:
Please, at all costs, avoid having *nested* repositories. That means, what you want to have is this:

• Folder 1
    ◦ Subfolder 1
    ◦ Subfolder 2 (is a :github: repository)
    ◦ Subfolder 3
    ◦ Subfolder 4 (is a :github: repository) 
And *not* this (nested!!):

• Folder 1 (is a :github: repository)
    ◦ Subfolder 1
    ◦ Subfolder 2 (is a :github: repository)
    ◦ Subfolder 3
    ◦ Subfolder 4 (is a :github: repository) 
Always keep git repositories next to each other, not within each other. So this is also possible:

• Folder 1
    ◦ Subfolder 1
    ◦ Subfolder 2 (is a :github: repository)
    ◦ Subfolder 3
        ▪︎ Subsubfolder1 (is a :github: repository)

• a presentation, max 5 mins (we will cut you off) which can be delivered with the help of slides, tableau dashboard or stories, a jupyter notebook with slide option configured, any other presentation mode that you think makes sense - remember the presentation should be rehearsed and slick, with useful and easy to follow visuals, not too much code or text heavy please-  as there will be external observers in the room 
• a github repo, containing your work from this week and relevant links, that is well structured (it should be obvious what is the final version, for example, and supporting files, which has a readme which helps us to navigate. 
• as mentioned <https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BEES-DAFT-MAY21/blob/main/Projects/Mid_Bootcamp/Data_Thieves.md|here> please do include your kanban board in your repo/readme.
• the readme *can* also be used for the short technical paper, but this could equally be created in Medium, or a pdf etc - the purpose of the paper is to describe your methods  in detail and your analytical findings, which you will not have time in the presentation to cover. 
here are some examples :
*this is a read me including a summary* <https://github.com/MikkiSeidenschnur/data_ber_dota2_winpredictor>

I was on a call with one of you. Pandas didn't like this query string in a `read_sql_query()` statement:
```'''SELECT t.account_id as accounts, date_format(convert(t.date,date), '%Y') as year, d.A2 as district_name, d.A3 as region, round(sum(t.amount)) as total_trans FROM trans t join account a on a.account_id = t.account_id join district d on t.account_id = d.A1 group by accounts, district_name, region, year'''```
it gives an
```pd.read_sql - Unsupported format character error (0x27)```
the problem is this `'%Y'`  expression in the date_format clause. It can be solved using the `sqlalchemy.text()`  function like this:

```import sqlalchmey as sa

# here you define your engine
###
# define the sql query

my_query_string = '''SELECT t.account_id as accounts, date_format(convert(t.date,date), '%Y') as year, d.A2 as district_name, d.A3 as region, round(sum(t.amount)) as total_trans FROM trans t join account a on a.account_id = t.account_id join district d on t.account_id = d.A1 group by accounts, district_name, region, year'''

# read the table from the sql query into a dataframe
# using sa.text()

df = pd.read_sql_query(sa.text(my_query_string), engine)```

2266,Sian Davies,"<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-series-str-replace-to-replace-text-in-a-series/>

i thought i would give an example plus regex tips if you wanted to take it further

Example : if we wanted to change a column of age, stored as int, with the words, we could look for one value, eg 38, in that column and replace it like:
`data[""Age""]*=*` `data[""Age""].str.replace(38, ""thirty eight"")`
another example, we want to remove the junk text that contains that pattern ‘38’ - lets say the string is
*“nearly38 years old”* 
we could use a regex pattern to identify all characters before the string ‘38’ and replace with nothing :
`data[""Age""]*=*` `data[""Age""].str.replace("".*(38)"", """")`
this returns *“years old”* because . finds any character and * allows you to take more than one character - that gives you all the letters up to 38, but includes 38.
adding a ?= makes the pattern  what we can call un greedy - so take all characters up to 38 but dont steal 38:
`data[""Age""]*=*` `data[""Age""].str.replace("".*(?=38)"", """")`
this returns *“38 years old”*

Rules:
• If both `Type 1` and `Type 2` have valid values, the `Combo Type` value should contain both values in the form of `&lt;Type 1&gt; &lt;Type 2&gt;`. For example, if `Type 1` value is `Grass` and `Type 2` value is `Poison`, `Combo Type` will be `Grass-Poison`.
• If `Type 1` has valid value but `Type 2` is not, `Combo Type` will be the same as `Type 1`. For example, if `Type 1` is `Fire` whereas `Type 2` is `NaN`, `Combo Type` will be `Fire`.

2312,Sian Davies,"we did a lot of wrangling type steps at the end of the first week of the course, also in your first project, the start of week 2 and 4- but a lot of these skills are from python (generic) lessons and techniques, like creating functions, using lambda, using map+apply, filter and reduce, str operations, or very helpfully, how to use if statements or case statements to categorise values into buckets. this is in the pre work too. at the end of week 4 you had a lot of practice with filtering, subsets and aggregations. all solutions are published.
 in general, once you have in mind what you want to do with a common, it may be about you experimenting and finding the easiest path to get to that result - whether via a function, a loop, a case statement etc

example which may be helpful for you - lets take column yr_renovated. We might conclude that the interesting thing is *whether* a renovation happened or not, not when it took place. one method might be to create a function which converts the year of renovation to a truefalse boolean
```def truefalse(x):
    if x == 0:
        n = 0
    elif x &gt; 0:
        n = 1
    return n

df_drop['yr_renovated']=df_drop['yr_renovated'].apply(truefalse)```
there are probably half a dozen ways to achieve the same thing for this column, including pandas replace, using regex, or a loc query - one reason to keep the true/false function generic is the same function be applied to other features:
```df['sqft_basement']=df['sqft_basement'].apply(truefalse)```
so now we have a flag for ‘has a basement’ and a flag for ‘has been renovated’",False,0,lab-questions,0,0,0,0,0,00:00:00,2021-07-05,12:49:00

keep in mind, if you decide to scrape other websites, you can come to a point where you *a)* choose a selector in your browser of - let's say an artist in a chart and if you then  *b)* try to find that content in your soup, you get no results. The reason for that could be, that the content you see in your browser (and the html that is generated there) is already the result of some Javascript code being executed. This content of course could be different (way more html) than the content you have put into your soup. Because the soup doesn't run Javascript.

There are ways in web scraping how to tackle this issue (Selenium, ... ). But at this point it would lead too far. So I would recommend searching for charts that don't run that much javascript where you indeed find the selectors in your soup.

My initial playlist has 151 songs and, as expected, was truncating at 100 results. So I did the for loop to get the 151 songs and stored it into a list called 'track_id'. The problem is that when I try to get the audio features of these 151 songs like this:
audio_feat=sp.audio_features(tracks=track_id)
it gives me error because I think this function only accepts 100 results instead of 151. Does anyone know how to get the audio features from a list of ids bigger thatn 100?

The question came up twice:
if you think about merging two dataframes on an ID (a song ID for example), make sure your two dataframes ID's are unique. You can check so if `len(df1['id'].unique())`  is equal to `len(df1['id'])` . In case you have duplicates with respect to the ID column, you need to drop the duplicates (for example with `df1 = df1.drop_duplicates(subset=['id'])` otherwise you get an ""explode"" of your rows... imagine 30 duplicate rows in one df want to join 20 counterparts in another df, that makes it 600 additional columns....",False,1,lab-questions,0,0,0,0,Sian Davies,00:00:00,2021-07-15,13:40:00

another thing:
One student collected the audio features (which come as dictionaries out of `sp.audiofeatures(&lt;some_track_id&gt;)` ) in a list, let's say `audio_feats_lst`. Not a bad idea, since you can directly feed that to a dataframe:
```feature_df = pd.DataFrame(audio_feats_lst)```
But it threw an Error ""NoneType attribute has no attribute .keys()"". The reason was, there was one empty dictionary hiding in the list (which of course had no attribute .keys()  - because of something went wrong when querying the API - we basicall don't care for only a few songs missing....

One solution is: You can try to quickly filter your `audio_feats_lst` for empty dictionaries with:
```audio_feats_clean = [dct for dct in audio_feats_lst if dct]```
that if condition at the end checks if `dct` is empty, because the bool value of empty stuff in Python is mostly False",False,0,lab-questions,2,Uroš Petković,0,0,0,13:48:00,2021-07-15,13:46:00

two things:
• when you evaluate your KMeans model (inertia, silhouette score) and you get bad results (e.g. total silhouette score near 0 - which means that a lot of your observations received cluster assignments quite near to other clusters), remember that KMeans is a distance sensitive algorithm. You need to properly scale you data that you train it with and if you want to squeeze out even more prediction power - even check the distribution of your features and log-transform them. If for example a feature such as accousticness is power law distributed (long tail... )  or a feature has outliers, you want to log transform (before standard scaling) it or use a robust scaler, so that the ""tailies"" don't mess up your mean of the feature. In any case, first plot the data to get a sense of their distribution
• Also regarding the `StandardScaler()` . I think Miguel mentioned it to some of you already: When you scale your features, keep that scaler object (with the information about the features standard deviation and mean) for later when the user input song waltzes in and wants to be clustered. Becaus its audio features also need to be scaled with that same StandardScaler.  So what you would do:
```# create an empty scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# fit the scaler (store mean and stddev of features in it)
scaler.fit(df_audio_features)

# transform your features according to stored info
audio_features = scaler.transform(df_audio_features)

# now use audio_features to train your KMeans
# TRAIN KMEAS CODE HERE

# now the input song arrives, wants a cluster. So scale its audio feats with the same Scaler from above
