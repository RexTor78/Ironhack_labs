- In this Final Project we can get a little glimpse of how messages move through slack.

- Probabily you have ever wondered know what words are the most ones that we have used in our messages, well here you can see them:

but be careful if you are not careful you can also get this results:

and surely it is not exactly what we are looking for, for that, take care of your code:

did you remember the stop.words?

Working with JSON files is sometimes not as simple as it seems and any small oversights can lead to big headaches.

That is why I am going to leave my notebook here so that you can browse it, it is a project that is still very open in which I will continue working, but I attach the links:

- [Jupyter Notebook][1]
- [Tableau Story][2] in this moment I need to clean and reorganize dashboards.
- [Pdf-Presentation][3] or [Powerpoint][4]
